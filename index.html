  <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p>After getting my sister and brother to both look at my newly created website, they both basicaly said the same thing which was that the website looked to bland to be from SpaceX. My brother told me to compare my website to Apple's website to see how good it looks. Taking this feedback I went online to search up some new images that could possibly spice up my webisite. I changed the background color of both the heading and the whole page (both siblings agreed the white background made it worse). This led to some unreadable text so after working more on the css I got the website to overall look more appealing and interesting compared to the first draft. It is no where close to Apple's website but it is better then a bland white background. </p>
  <p>I can easily say that I learn a lot about web development this semester. I first learned how to get the content of the website on the page using HTML. Then I learned how to style it with CSS. And towards the end I learned how to make my website be able to do things that websites are known to do with JavaScript. The SpaceX Dragon project brought all that together and gave me a taste of what building a website from scratch feels like. Although I couldnâ€™t really get the JS to work on my website the way I wanted to, I would say that the project is a good reflection of what I learned this semester.</p>
  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>Progressive enhancement can be seen as starting with the necessities, which in the case of web development is the content. It does not matter how pretty a website looks if the content is not available to users. The PE method helps make sure the content is on the page for all users before decorating it with CSS. It is important that modern web developers use this method since the number of screens that a website can be displayed on is at its greatest right now. The processing power from screen to screen can differ so it is best that at least the content is getting to the user rather then the glam. </p>
